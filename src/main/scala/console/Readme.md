# A simple demo task to case study Monad vs Applicative vs Arrow 

## Implement a Console process with four simple methods:
1. read line
2. write line
3. echo2 : read two lines from the input and print concatenated string to  the output
4. countGets  calculate how many lines would be read

We will use Cats categories for all three implementations
